:> ok, so maybe unconventional for blogging, but I'll try using github for that :P

I know it's a ridiculous idea, but who else thought about it? lol

Anyhow, I really have made progress with git in general and try to use it at
work too, although we use svn for the repository.

Subversion really made me weep. It makes version control such a burden compared
to git. That said, it was not an easy task to just switch to git. Trying,
   trying again. Succeed, fail, try again.

If all goes well I will become fluent in git and give subversion the boot :)
